			<p>Another trembling step into the wide, wide
			world of generative art;  an image that draws
			itself.</p>
			
			<p>Inspired by, among others:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Brent Gustafson, <a href="http://www.vitaflo.com/v8/">Vitaflo</a></li>
				<li>Glen Murphy, <a href="http://bodytag.org/nav.php?u=compose3/">bodytag</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Designed to create smoother transitions between the colors
			than its predecessor, <a href="../lines01/">lines01</a>.  This
			sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't, as you can probably
			see above.  An explanation of the process can be found to the
			left.</p>

			<h3>Algorithm-in-English</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>pick a random color</li>
				<li>paint the canvas with a line this color</li>
				<li>pick another color, based on the first, that is a random (but limited) distance away from the first</li>
				<li>paint the canvas with a line of this new color</li>
				<li>pick another color, based on the second, that is a random (but limited) distance away from the second</li>
				<li>paint the canvas with a line of this new color</li>
				<li>repeat, until you've gone the desired number of steps (in this case, the width of the canvas)</li>

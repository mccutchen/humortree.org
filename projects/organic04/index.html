<h5>&ldquo;&nbsp;Organic Motion #4&nbsp;&rdquo;</h5>
<div class="pad10">

<strong>Usage&mdash;</strong>Press the "add" button to add an
organism to the "world."  Press the "remove" button to remove one organism
from the world.  I think that it is really interesting looking if you add
a whole lot of organisms.  And try this: Press stop.  Then, add as many
organisms as you want (the more the better).  Once you've clicked "add"
a number of times, press start, and watch the nice effect.
<br><br>
<strong>Explanation&mdash;</strong>It was only a matter of time, I
guess.  I've finally got myself some organic motion that I like.
It took me three tries, but I don't know if that is good or bad.
<br><br>
To review&mdash;
<ol>
	<li><a href="../organic01/">Organic01</a>, the first attempt, was
	a poor model of organic motion.  It was very jerky, because the "organisms"
	could only move in straight lines.<br><br></li>
	
	<li><a href="../raindrops/">raindrops</a> (which is also Organic 2), was a better
	model of organic motion, but it was very poorly coded, and was thus very slow.<br><br></li>
	
	<li><a href="../physics03/">Physics03</a> (which is also Organic 3), was much,
	much smoother, because it was based on some pseudo-physics involving 
	friction, elasticity, and repulsion.  It was still a poor model, because
	it required a lot of extraneous code to function.  It was not neat.</li>
</ol>
This project, Organic 4, uses some very basic Trigonometry to dictate
the motion of the "organisms."  This is the way I should have done it
from the beginning, but this idea didn't even occur to me until recently.

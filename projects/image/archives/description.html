		This is an archive of images created with the random-image-generation
		PHP script that i wrote.  These are images that have been saved by me,
		manually, because something in them appealed to me.
		<br>
		<br>
		I'd like to implement a system to let you, User, save images that you
		like to my server, to add to the collection.  I cannot, though, because
		right now, the server has a peculiar tendency to turn up some identical
		images repeatedly.  When running the script locally, i do not have this
		problem, so all of the pictures in this archive, right now, were created
		on my computer, and not on my server.

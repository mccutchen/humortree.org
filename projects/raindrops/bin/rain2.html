	<strong>RAINDROPS - organic motion #2</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	This is another experiment that attempts to simulate Organic Motion,
	much like "organic01."  This one, however, tries to simulate raindrops
	rolling down a surface, like a window.<br><br>
	The whole thing is based on sine waves.  Each "raindrop" is started
	at a random place on the "surface" to the left, and runs down it,
	with its horizontal position dictated by an equation for a sine
	wave.  The equation is different for each raindrop.  Also, for
	each raindrop, the equation is changed after it has run through
	one whole period (the period of the equation <strong>y&nbsp;=&nbsp;sin&nbsp;x</strong>
	is 2PI).<br><br>
	I don't know how much sense that made.<br><br>
	This is <strong>very</strong> processor intensive, so your computer
	may get quite sluggish while looking at this.  This is the reason
	that I am letting you decide how many raindrops to look at, to the
	left.<br><br>
	It looks very nice on Windows NT/2000, and might look decent on a Mac.
	If you happen to be using Windows 9x/ME, just imagine that the raindrops
	are all rolling smoothly down the surface to the left, instead of skipping
	slowly down it.

To the left is a short story that i wrote, spur
of the moment, when i first made this site.  As
you can see, it has been censored.  

The story was pure fiction.  It was about the day 
in 1973 when my father died at the hands of law 
enforcement officers, defending his land.  The law
enforcement officers were illegally trespassing, 
and they,in the story, killed him.

The story goes on to say that i have vowed to put 
an end to organized law enforcement.  I proclaim 
that i will not rest until i have put an end to all
police officers, sheriffs, firemen, etc.  The story
ends with a call to arms: 

"burn your local police station!"

The story could not possibly be true.  My father is 
not dead. If he had died in 1973, i would not be here.
I was born in 1981.  Local law enforcement officers got 
wind of this site, and read that, and considered taking
legal action against me.  They have not yet, but that 
is why it is censored.
		
Incidentally, this site was also kept out of a recent 
Student Art Competition at the local Museum of Fine Arts.
The administration of my school felt that it was too 
inflammatory.  They claimed they were looking out for me.  
As it happens, the person who alerted the police about my
"terroristic threat" was said to work at the school.  It
is interesting to me.

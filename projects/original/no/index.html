            		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was around ten years old, I came down with the flu.  I was a happy
            		sick boy because I got the chance to miss school, which my parents hardly ever let me do.  I started
            		feeling sick late one evening, and made this known to my parents, just in case they were going to
            		cave in and let me miss a day or two.  In the morning, my mother woke me gingerly and asked in a
            		trying-not-to-disturb-you voice, "Do you feel up to school today?" Leaping on the opportunity,  I 
            		very weakly nodded and replied, very slowly and painfully, "I don't know, but I don't think so..."  I
            		let my voice trail off.  It was unwise to let the parent know that you are eager to stay home.  My
            		mother decided that it would be best if I stayed at home that day, and went downstairs to help prepare
            		my sister to catch the bus. After a little while, she came back to my room with a can of ginger ale,
            		which she tended to employ as a substitute for chicken noodle soup as a cold remedy.  I took a very 
            		small sip and winced, far too ill to be enjoying a tasty beverage.  My mother said some soothing
            		words and told me to go back to sleep, if I could, and that she would be back up later to check on me.
            		I rolled over as she walked out of the room and shut my eyes. The main problem with staying home from
            		school is staying in bed enough that your parents do not catch on to your trickery.  Normally, it
            		would have been a strain to lie in bed all morning, but I was lucky enough this morning to actually
            		fall back to sleep. My mother woke me up again around ten or so.  She said, rather gently, that she
            		had to run to the local ___-mart general store to pick some stuff up.  She did not know whether or not
            		to leave me at home, or take me with her.  I assured her that I would be fine at home, that I would
            		probably just fall right back asleep.  Moderately placated, she left for the sprawling complex that was
            		___-mart. As soon as I heard the garage door shut, I leaped out of bed and jogged downstairs, ravenous
            		and searching for nourishment.  I carried my bowl of cereal over to the den and sat on the sofa.  No 
            		food was allowed outside of the kitchen at that time, but I was on a holiday and feeling rebellious.
            		Sitting on the sofa, luxuriating in my Life brand cereal, I thought for a minute about my friends stuck
            		in class and decided that I was probably missing the math portion of my day.  I was extremely distraught
            		over this, and sought solace in the warm embrace of the television.	Another problem with staying home
            		from school is the lack of enjoyable television programming to be found during the day.  I was forced
            		to choose from a handful of soap operas, which really were not my style at that age, and another
            		handful of Info-mercials, which, it	turns out, were even less my style.

            		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally settled on a show called "All My Children," which I knew
            		that my grandmother, my father's mother, was particularly fond of.  I could remember sitting with her
            		to watch it, and her talking to the characters, a woman named Erica in particular.  I searched the TV
            		for precious Erica, so that I might give her advice in an homage to my grandmother. By the time I had
            		finished my cereal, "All My Children" was over, replaced by a terrible new soap opera that I had never
            		heard of before.  As I rose to carry my dishes to the sink, I thought I heard the big wooden gate
            		outside open and shut.  I hurried into the kitchen and washed out my bowl and placed it in the dish
            		washer. As I strolled casually back into the den, I noticed the man standing on the porch outside,
            		peering through the large picture windows.  I froze, paralyzed with fear.  My worst nightmare, a fear
            		that I had been nursing for as long as I could remember, was standing on my back porch, jiggling my
            		door knob, peering into my den.  All at once, a flood of memories rushed past my eyes:  The night my
            		older sister/baby sitter made us hide in the attic because she thought she heard someone downstairs.
            		All of the sleep I had lost, lying in bed and staring out my window, willing whatever criminals were
            		out there not to come to my house.  The time we came back from vacation and walked in to the sound of
            		breaking glass and running, a burglar fleeing our house.  All of this was wrapped up in the dark
            		figure scanning the room that I was on the fringe of. He was a tall man, but skinny, wearing black
            		tennis shoes, well worn, that reminded me slightly of the sort that basketball referees wear.  He had
            		on blue jeans, but old to the point of looking almost white.  He was wearing a two-tone winter coat
            		that looked new, in vibrant blue and green.  Covering his hands was a pair of black leather gloves.
            		The glove covering his right hand, the hand on the doorknob, was missing an index finger.  His neck
            		and chin had not seen a razor in quite a while.  His skin was reddish in hue, and his eyes, his eyes
            		were looking right at mine.	He had stopped twisting the doorknob and was now staring at me.  I was
            		entranced, could not look away.  I could feel my body trembling, and my head started to swim, staring
            		at him, at those eyes.  Finally, after what seemed like hours, he broke eye-contact and ran back
            		through the gate. I did not ever see him again.  I did not tell my mother what happened, or anyone
            		else in my family, for that matter.  I kept it locked inside of me, to come back to, to review.  I
            		have never stayed home from school for illness since.

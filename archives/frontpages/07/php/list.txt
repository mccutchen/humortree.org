The original version of Humor Tree, the 1999/2000 projects, were
developed as a sort of art project. They go in a series, and it
is best if you experience them that way, from beginning to end.

They were written by someone (me) just learning the ropes, so
many will probably not work in newer browsers.  But, i think
it's worth it to go ahead and try them out.

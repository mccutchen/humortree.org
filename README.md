Per [the web site][ht]'s intro:

I still make occasional attempts to fix the behavior of old projects on modern
browsers, or dig ephemera out of the Wayback Machine, but this repo mostly
serves as a kind of living archive of an extended period of artistic output
from my late teens to early twenties.

Making these weird little art projects is how and why I learned to program
computers, which semi-accidentally turned into a career in software.

I didn't discover version control (starting with Subversion) until much later,
so the history here is woefully incomplete and cobbled together from a
combination of old backups and the Internet Archive's invaluable Wayback
Machine.

Per [the web site][ht]'s intro:

> The original [Humor Tree][ht] was a turn-of-the century [net.art][] project

> art competition hosted by the [Longview Museum of Fine Arts][lmfa] in
> [Longview, Texas][lv].
>
> Despite the enthusiastic support of the director of the LMFA and one of two

> Fox-Hearne][cfh] and Ellen Herbert! — plus the generous sponsorship of the

> administrators of [Longview High School][lhs] and the Longview Independent
> School District because I refused to censor the project by removing a few

I still make occasional attempts to fix the behavior of old projects on modern
browsers, or dig ephemera out of the Wayback Machine, but this repo mostly
serves as a kind of living archive of an extended period of artistic output
from my late teens to early twenties.

Making these weird little art projects is how and why I learned to program
computers, which semi-accidentally turned into a career in software.

I didn't discover version control (starting with Subversion) until much later,
so the history here is woefully incomplete and cobbled together from a
combination of old backups and the Internet Archive's invaluable Wayback
Machine.

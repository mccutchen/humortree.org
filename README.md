Per [the web site][ht]'s intro:

> The original [Humor Tree][ht] was a turn-of-the century [net.art][] project
> developed at the tail end of my high school career for entry in the annual
> senior-year art competition hosted by the [Longview Museum of Fine
> Arts][lmfa] in [Longview, Texas][lv].
>
> Despite the enthusiastic support of an art teacher at the school, the
> director of the museum itself, and the generous sponsorship of the local Best
> Buy, this project was barred from that competition first by the
> administrators of [Longview High School][lhs] and then by the assistant
> superintendent of the school district, all because I refused to remove a mild
> swear and a handful of disembodied (and almost entirely male) nipples.
>
> All of the code was written very badly by a novice programmer for very old
> web browsers, using what were then _cutting-edge_ Web programming techniques
> which are now mostly outdated and/or broken.
>
> In the intervening decades (!!!) I have made minimal updates to try to keep
> things working in modern browsers while retaining the (awful) character of
> the original code, but there is undoubtedly still some brokenness throughout.

I still make occasional attempts to fix the behavior of old projects on modern
browsers, or dig ephemera out of the Wayback Machine, but this repo mostly
serves as a kind of living archive of an extended period of artistic output
from my late teens to early twenties.

Making these weird little art projects is how and why I learned to program
computers, which semi-accidentally turned into a career in software.

I didn't discover version control (starting with Subversion) until much later,
so the history here is woefully incomplete and cobbled together from a
combination of old backups and the Internet Archive's invaluable Wayback
Machine.

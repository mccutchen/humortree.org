		FOR YEARS, THE GREAT NATION OF CANADA HAS BEEN UNDER THE CRUEL FIST OF TYRANNY!  THEY HAVE BORNE THEIR BURDEN NOBLY, IN THE FACE
		OF MANY HARDSHIPS!  THE TIME HAS COME, HOWEVER, FOR THEM TO STRUGGLE OUT FROM UNDER THE YOKE OF ITALIAN FASCISM!  THEIR CHILDREN
		HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED FOR THE LAST TIME!  NO MORE OF MOUSSILINI'S INSIDIOUS SLOGANS ("BELIEVE! OBEY! FIGHT!") ARE GOING TO BE
		SMUGGLED INTO THEIR IMPRESSIONABLE BRAINS.  JOIN WITH ME! JOIN WITH ME TO SAVE CANADA!  WE MUST FIGHT!  REMEMBER, SOME OF YOU WILL
		DIE, ASSUREDLY.  OTHERS OF YOU WILL PROBABLY BREAK RANKS AND RUN LIKE SISSIES!  BUT THOSE OF YOU WHO COME OUT OF THIS WAR ALIVE,
		AND NOT HUMILIATED LIKE LITTLE GIRLS, WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO STAND UP FOR, SOMETHING TO BE PROUD ABOUT!  IT IS TIME TO GIVE
		CANADA HER LIBERTY!  HER LIBERTY, AT ANY COST!  SO, BRETHREN, JOIN WITH ME, SINGING "JOY OF THE JOY OF CANADA AND THEREIN PROVIDING
		LIBERTY ALL AROUND" AS WE MARCH INTO THE GREAT ICY NORTH TO BESTOW UPON THAT GREAT NATION THE ONE THING THAT SHE MISSES MOST:
		<A HREF="javascript:unit();" style="color:black;">LIBERTY!</a>

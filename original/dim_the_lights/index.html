        <div id="two" class="stripe"><p>I KNEW A GIRL, ONCE, WHO TRIED TO BE
        MY FRIEND. SHE USED TO TO SIT BY ME AT LUNCH TIME IN THE CAFETERIA,
        BUT I WOULD ALWAYS GET UP AND PRETEND TO BE DONE EATING. SHE NEVER
        LOOKED OFFENDED, EVEN THOUGH SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT I WAS DOING.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="three" class="stripe"><p>SHE WAS IN MY ENGLISH CLASS AND SAT
        TWO SEATS BEHIND ME. DURING EACH CLASS PERIOD, SHE WOULD WRITE ME
        LITTLE NOTES, SILLY THINGS, AND PASS THEM UP TO ME. THEY ALWAYS ENDED
        IN THE SAME WAY: "THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD, BUT I AM
        NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEM. I AM ONLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU." I NEVER PASSED
        ANY NOTES BACK TO HER.</p></div>

        <div id="four" class="stripe"><p>THEN SHE MOVED AWAY, BUT I DON'T KNOW
        WHERE TO. BEFORE SHE LEFT, SHE CALLED ME ON THE TELEPHONE. I HUNG UP
        ON HER. SHE CALLED AGAIN, AND I HUNG UP ON HER AGAIN. SHE CALLED FOR A
        THIRD TIME, AND I LET HER TALK. SHE TOLD ME THAT WHEN SHE FIRST SAW
        ME, I DID SOMETHING THAT MADE HER FALL IN LOVE WITH ME COMPLETELY. I
        ASKED HER WHAT I HAD DONE. SHE SAID THAT I HAD GIVEN MY SWEATSHIRT TO
        A BOY WHO HAD SPILLED CHOCOLATE MILK DOWN THE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT, EVEN
        THOUGH IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE. I DENIED EVER HAVING DONE ANYTHING LIKE
        THAT, AND HUNG UP ON HER AGAIN. SHE DIDN'T CALL BACK.</p></div>

Here is the original version of the story under the
Humor Tree logo:<br>
<img src="images/logo.gif">

This story could not possibly be true.  My father is
not dead. If he had died in 1973, I would not be here.
I was born in 1981.  Local law enforcement officers got
wind of this site, and read that, and considered taking
legal action against me.  They have not yet, but that
is why it is censored.

Apparently, they did not like the call to arms and the
order to "burn your local police station".

Incidentally, this site was also kept out of a student art
competition in the Spring of 2000 at the Longview Museum of
Fine Arts.  The administration of Longview High School and
the Longview Independent School District felt that it was
too inflammatory.
